# library-management
A Library Management System using PHP and MySQL

Users can enter data into the database system using the front end interface which gets stored at the back end database. Data can also be retrieved from the database using the interface.

The front end interface is made with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The back end is a MySQL database. Both have been linked through PHP (using Wamp).
